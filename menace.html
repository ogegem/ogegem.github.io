            <h2>About Certified Menance {to the Patriarchy}</h2>
            <p>Certified Menance {to the Patriarchy} is a space born out of the necessity to scream quietly, to articulate the inarticulable frustrations, hopes, rage and resilience of being a woman in Nigeria. It is a love letter to women who are tired of being silenced, overlooked, and underestimated. Feminism is not foreign to us-it is survival.</p>
            <h2>Welcome to the Certified Menance Blog</h2>
            <p>This blog is dedicated to the girlies who refused to stay small, and the women who made noise anyway. 💖</p>

        <h2>About the Writer</h2>
        <p>I'm the storm patriarchy warned itself about. Feminism, for me, isn't just theory - it's fire, it's resistance. I write to remember, to rage, and to reclaim. I'm that sharp-tongued, over-thinking, big-hearted Nigeria woman who has had enough. This space is my megaphone, and I fully intend to be loud with it.</p>
